quote_str = """The greatest glory in living lies not in never falling, but in rising every time we fall.
You will face many defeats in life, but never let yourself be defeated
He who is not courageous enough to take risks will accomplish nothing in life.
It isn't where you came from it's where you're going that counts.
Real change, enduring change, happens one step at a time.
The journey of a thousand miles begins with one step."""
