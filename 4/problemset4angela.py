    "Beat your eggs until they're completely blended. Add a little water, cream or milk to make them tender. Use 1 tablespoon of liquid per egg. Add a pinch of salt.",
    "Next, heat a nonstick skillet over a medium-low flame and toss in a pat of butter. Make sure the butter coats the pan.",
    "Then, pour in the eggs. Pause to let them heat slightly â€” gentle heat is essential.",
    "Move the eggs across the pan like a bulldozer so the eggs cook evenly. This takes a little time, but it's worth it.",
    "As the eggs start to set, add chopped fresh herbs, or bits of ham or cheese.",
